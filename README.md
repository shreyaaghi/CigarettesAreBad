Purpose: To inform teenagers and their families about tobacco use

Components:

Information page - Whether it’s the contents of a cigarette, the consequences of second-hand smoke, or the scientific reasoning behind teenage vaping, the information page combines graphs, images, and expert data to fully educate the user on everything to know about tobacco use in teenagers. 

Quiz - Determines what the user retrieved from the information page and helps strengthen their general knowledge of tobacco use. There are 10 multiple choice questions that vary in difficulty, and the user is provided with the correct answers once submitted.

Resources page - The reality of smoking is that it is a real addiction, and once someone starts it’s hard to stop. The user is presented with multiple hotlines and websites that will give them the help they need to quit for good. Additionally, there are other organizations and links posted where users can help get involved with smoking cessation acts near them. 

These 3 components work together to create an app that will be used by teenagers, parents, and educators so they can help spread awareness of this rising issue and put an end to smoking & vaping in teenagers.
